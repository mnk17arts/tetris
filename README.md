+ Points will be given to the user when the rows of the grid are filled by the tetrominos . The points will be shown in the side screen. The points will be increased by 10 for every filled row. That row gets vanished after points are increased.

+ The game ends when the tetromino reaches the top of the grid. Then a `Game Over` alert is shown. The user can again start the game by clicking on the `Start` button.
